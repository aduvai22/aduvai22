## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Adnan Abdullah, a second year Ph.D. student in the department of ECE, University of Florida. I completed my Bachelor of Science (BSc) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology with a major in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. My research interest is primarily in the field of embedded deep learning for marine robotics and on-device vision. Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at RoboPI Lab where I am leading several projects focusing on visual perception and audio-visual signal understanding for secure communication of mobile robots in adverse sensing conditions. I am also working on state estimation and localization of mobile robots in long-term exploratory missions.
